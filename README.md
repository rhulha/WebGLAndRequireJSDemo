What do you get with this demo project ?

* A beautiful WebGL engine modularized using RequireJS.
* A simple node based scene graph.
* A 6 degrees of freedom Camera class without Gimbal-Lock ( think space ship view).
* A Spatial class that allows objects to be moved and rotated relative to its current position.
* 3 shader programs included (points, textured, color ).
* Learn how to use RequireJS to load shader source files easily.
* Learn an effective way to switch shader programs.
* WebGL particles using the included points shader.
* Matrix calculations are done with the excellent gl-matrix.
* A strong case why and how to use RequireJS with WebGL
* incl. the text and domReady extensions for RequireJS.

__Please note__ this is __not a full featured engine__ like ThreeJS or CubicVRJS.

This project is aimed at giving programmers a __good starting point__ if they want to work with __pure WebGL__.
